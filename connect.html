            </h3>

                <h4 class="review">Review of Esteemed</h4>
                    <p>As someone who has has been fortunate to be part of several of Jamie Hulker’s Bible Studies, I can say
                    that the The Esteemed Study was one of my favorites. Jamie’s knowledge and research are evident in this
                    insightful and in-depth exposition of strong female women during biblical times. She presents the
                    information in ways that are relatable and easy to understand but that are grounded in scripture.
                    </p>
                     <p>Although some of the stories are familiar, Jamie challenged the group to put aside preconceived ideas and
                    focus solely on scripture. There were several women included in the study that I was not familiar with
                    and found their stories to be powerful and encouraging. I gained valuable insight into some incredible
                    women that God esteemed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether you are wanting to deepen your knowledge of the Bible, needing encouragement or just looking for
                    food for thought, I cannot recommend this engaging study enough. It definitely encouraged to me and gave
                    me a fresh perspective of how God sees me and my role in His kingdom.
                    </p>

                <h4 class="review">Esteemed has rocked my world in the best way!
                </h4>
                <p>Women were not created to be seen and not heard. Biblical womanhood is fierce, and I am so grateful for
                    the opportunity to study the many women God has used in crucial roles for His kingdom.
                </p>

                <h4 class="review">Impactful
                </h4>
                <p>Jamie’s study Esteemed is an insightful study into the women of the Bible and how God used each of them. The study experience left me amazed, and was a great reminder of just how many women he did use, and how he prepared each one for her purpose. It brought into focus the impact these women had then and how God can use women in the present day as well.</p>
