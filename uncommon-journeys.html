                        <p>Embark on an extraordinary adventure as we trace the Apostle Paul’s journey and explore the world of the early Christians. Our journey begins in Istanbul, Turkey—a vibrant city where ancient history and modern culture collide. From there, we’ll travel to the spectacular ruins of Ephesus, one of the best-preserved ancient cities in the world. Walk through its grand streets, marvel at the impressive Temple of Artemis, and stand in awe of the ancient theater where Paul once preached.</p>
                        <p>Next, we’ll head to Greece, where the history and beauty of the ancient world come alive. In Athens, walk among the ruins of the Acropolis, where Paul boldly spoke to the philosophers at Mars Hill. In Corinth, stand where Paul spent time teaching and building the early Church, and in Thessaloniki, feel the legacy of Paul’s letters to the church that continues to echo through the ages. We’ll visit Berea, where the people eagerly received the gospel, and Philippi, the site of Paul’s first church in Europe, where the early believers began to shape the future of the Christian faith.</p>
                        <p>For those who wish, the adventure can extend to the Eternal City—Rome, where Paul was imprisoned and eventually martyred, completing the circle of this life-changing journey. This is more than a trip; it’s an uncommon journey into the heart of Scripture. Don’t miss this unforgettable experience!</p>
