            <p>The Gospel is centered on:</p>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>God's Love:</strong> God loves all people and desires a relationship with them. Despite human sin and separation from God, His love remains constant.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Jesus' Life and Sacrifice:</strong> Jesus Christ, God the Son, came to earth, lived a perfect life, and willingly sacrificed Himself on the cross to pay the penalty for humanity's sins. His death and resurrection provide the means for reconciliation with God.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Forgiveness and Redemption:</strong> Through Jesus' sacrifice, anyone who believes in Him can receive forgiveness of sins and brought into a right relationship with God. This is a gift of grace, not something earned by human effort.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>New Life:</strong> Belief in Jesus leads to the assurance of eternal life in Heaven and the direction and empowerment of the Holy Spirit to guide believers to live according to God's will.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Invitation:</strong> The Gospel invites everyone to respond by faith—trusting in Jesus for salvation and committing to follow Him.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you have never decided to put your faith in Jesus’ death and resurrection as the sacrificial atonement for your sin, you can do that right now through prayer. Talk to God and tell Him your decision to trust Jesus, then ask Him to lead and guide you throughout your life until you see Him face-to-face one day!
