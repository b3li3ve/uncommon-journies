            <h1>Running the Race: Unity and Camaraderie
            </h1>
            <p>I’ve always wanted to be an Olympian. When we visited Athens, Greece, a few years ago, visiting the Olympic Stadium was as thrilling as seeing the Acropolis. Standing atop the podium, imagining myself in an Olympic arena—it was a moment I’ll never forget. Although I may never compete at the Olympic level (unless I find a way to qualify for the Senior Olympics!), that brief moment on the podium sparked the same passion for the Olympic Games I’ve had since childhood.</p>
            <p>So, what draws me so strongly to the Olympics? I know it’s not the years and years of intense training to be an Olympian, although I respect the discipline and admire those who put in that level of work. It’s also not the competition. If you know me, you might question that statement—I’m competitive, yes, but that isn’t my main reason for following the Games so loyally.</p>
            <p>What truly captivates me about the Olympics can be summed up in two words: <strong>unity and camaraderie</strong>. From the beginning, I’ve been drawn to the Olympics for the way athletes and entire nations come together with a shared spirit. The stories of selflessness, of athletes helping one another even at great personal cost, or the sacrifices families make in support of their athletes—these are the moments that stay with us long after the Games end.</p>
            <strong>
                <p>A Deeper Longing for Unity</p>
            </strong>
            <p>Reflecting on this past summer’s Olympics in Paris, I find myself longing for that same unity and camaraderie within the Church, the worldwide Body of Christ. Here’s a quote that recently struck me:</p>
            <p>“If we take seriously the impact of the gospel of Jesus Christ for slave and free, and Jew and Gentile, then what are the implications of the radical new existence for men and women as brothers and sisters 'in the Lord' and coheirs with Christ?”</p>
            <p>Galatians 3 echoes this message:</p>
            <p>"For you are all sons and daughters of God through faith in Christ Jesus… There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus." (NIV)</p>
            <p>I long for this type of unity in the Church that transcends our divisions. One of my deepest desires and regular prayers is that the Church would set aside the things that so easily divide us so that we can better reflect Christ to a world desperately in need of Him.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, I’d like to share thoughts that might help.</p>
            <strong>
                <p>Convictions: The Core of Our Faith</p>
            </strong>
            <p>Sometimes, differences in beliefs could lead to division in the Church. These are called convictions or core beliefs. Convictions center on primary issues of the faith, grounded in Scripture and focused on Jesus, His work on the cross, and what is essential for salvation. We should hold very few convictions. </p>
            <p>I hold three convictions or essentials over which I would divide fellowship if necessary.</p>
            <strong>
                <p>Persuasions: Deeply Held, Openly Shared</p>
            </strong>
            <p>Next are persuasions. Persuasions are informed positions on non-essential biblical topics we’ve personally studied and prayed through. These are beliefs we hold strongly, but they don’t touch on salvation or the core tenets of the faith. Persuasions should never be reasons to demean other believers or used to separate us from our brothers and sisters in Christ; instead, they offer opportunities for meaningful conversations and deeper understanding.</p>
            <p>While we can hold firm to our persuasions, we must respect others’ perspectives. Persuasions may shape how we live out our faith, but they should never threaten our unity. After all, before He went to the cross, Jesus prayed specifically for our unity as His followers. Our goal isn’t uniformity but a unity that reflects God’s love and draws others in.</p>
            <strong>
                <p>Opinions: Personal Preferences Held Loosely</p>
            </strong>
            <p>Then, there are opinions. Opinions come from personal experiences or preferences rather than scriptural convictions. We all have opinions; sharing them is natural, but they should never become reasons for division. Instead, let’s enjoy the diversity they bring, understanding that unity doesn’t mean we all have to think alike. I’m happy to share my opinions, even before you ask! ☺ I have a lot of opinions, but I won’t ever divide fellowship over my opinions!</p>
            <strong>
                <p>Unity in Action: The 4x100 Relay</p>
            </strong>
            <p>Let me close with an Olympic metaphor—the iconic 4x100m relay race. In the Church, our convictions are like the rules of the track; they set the boundaries and are essential and non-negotiable. But our persuasions and opinions? They’re more like our running styles. They’re important, yes, but they need to be held loosely enough that we can smoothly pass the baton of unity.</p>
            <p>Paul reminds us in Ephesians 4:3:</p>
            <p>"Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.” (NIV)</p>
            <p>This passage encourages us: we don’t have to create the unity of the Spirit. Jesus already accomplished that for us. Our calling is to guard and protect this unity. We trust our fellow believers to faithfully run their part of the race, knowing we’re all moving toward the same goal.</p>
            <p>Just as a relay team wins by staying focused on the shared goal, the Church thrives when we uphold our convictions while allowing room for different perspectives on non-essential matters. Let’s run this race together, making every effort to guard or keep our unity in Christ. This matters!</p>

            <h2>How about you?</h2>
            <p>How about you? How do you discern between beliefs that you’d be willing to divide fellowship over and those that don’t merit that kind of reaction?            </p>
