                <p><strong><em>Jamie Hulker: Here for You</em></strong> is a nondenominational discipleship ministry that believes in the following: </p>
                    <h4>THE FATHER</h4>
                    <p>The first person of the Trinity orders and directs all things according to His purpose and pleasure. He has created humanity to bring Him glory and honor through His grace. While He is transcendent, He is also actively involved in His creation—offering an eternal relationship with us through His Son, Jesus Christ. (Matthew 6:9; John 5:19-24; Ephesians 1:3-6; 2:1-10)                    </p>
                    <h4>THE SON</h4>
                    <p>Jesus Christ is both God's eternal Son and a virgin-born man. Fully God, fully man, He surrendered nothing of His deity during His earthly life. His sinless, sacrificial offering on the cross satisfied the Father’s justice, offering atonement for all of humanity’s sins for all time. We believe in His bodily resurrection, physical ascension, and visible return to earth to establish His earthly kingdom. (John 1:14-18; Colossians 1:15-20)</p>

                <h4>THE HOLY SPIRIT</h4>
                <p>The Holy Spirit executes the will of God in this world by leading, guiding, filling, teaching, and convicting humanity. The Holy Spirit is not merely an impersonal force but is a person displaying the qualities of personhood (intellect, emotions, and will). The Holy Spirit equips believers, irrespective of gender, upon conversion by giving them gifts to be used for the building up of the church and by bearing fruit through their yielded lives. (John 16:7-11; Ephesians 2:10; Ephesians 1:13-14; Galatians 5:22-25)</p>

                <h4>HUMANITY</h4>
                <p>We believe that mankind is created in the image of God and that together (male and female), they reflect that image. </p>
                <p>We also believe that mankind is destined to enjoy an intimate relationship with God and with one another; however, because of Adam and Eve’s willful sin in the garden, sin entered the world and infected all of humanity. As a result, mankind was separated from God, spiritually dead, destined for physical death, and an eternity removed from God. (Genesis 1-3; Romans 1:18-32; Romans 5:12-21; Ephesians 2:1-3)</p>

                <h4>SALVATION</h4>
                <p>We believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins as the only sufficient sacrifice that can offer atonement for the sins of mankind. Further, we believe that through His death, burial, and resurrection that salvation from the above referenced ramifications of sin is available to all who ask Him for that free gift accomplished only by the finished work of Christ on the cross. As a result of this new relationship with God through His Son, Jesus, we are called to a life of submission to the Holy Spirit, manifesting spiritual fruit, and walking in good works that God has prepared beforehand for us to do. (John 14:6; Acts 4:12; John 1:12; Ephesians 1:7, 2:8-9; Hebrews 10:10-14; 1 John 5:11-13; Galatians 3:26; John 3:16)</p>

                <h4>THE SCRIPTURES</h4>
                <p>We believe every word in the original writings of the canonical Old and New Testaments is inspired by God and is without error in the original manuscripts. We affirm that God’s Word is accurate in all matters, infallible, and should be interpreted in its normal sense. We also affirm that while it reveals God’s nature and will for all of humanity and is the foundation and final authority for faith and practice, it is not given as an end in and of itself but rather a means to a relationship with God. (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Hebrews 4:12; John 17:17)</p>
                <p>We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the verbally inspired Word of God, the final authority for faith, life; and practice; infallible; and to be interpreted in their normal, literal sense. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21; Matt. 5:18; John 16:12-13.)</p>

                <h4>THE KINGDOM</h4>
                <p>God promises to make all things new at the end of all things. He invites us, His followers, to join Him in this work of renewal on earth. The signs of His kingdom coming are salvation, joy, peace, justice, God’s presence, belonging, and healing. (Revelation 21:5)</p>

                <h4>NONESSENTIALS</h4>
                <p>We affirm that the doctrines of the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the bodily resurrection, the atoning work of Christ on the cross, and salvation by grace through faith make up the essential, distinctive nature of Christianity. We acknowledge that there are peripheral, nonessential doctrines that are important to fellow believers but may not be critical to salvation. While TUJ may hold positions on these nonessentials, we will not allow these doctrines to cause division within our ministry or with those we minister to or alongside. (John 17:20-21) </p>
