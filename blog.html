                    <p class="scripture">“Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives…” (1 Thess. 1:8a)</p>

                <p>At <strong><em>Jamie Hulker: Here for You</em></strong>, we hope to create opportunities to study God’s eternal, life-changing Word and to <strong>encourage</strong> others by sharing what God is doing in our lives while learning about what He is doing in yours. We believe that sharing life together is essential to our walk with Jesus. Witnessing how God is working in the lives of other believers—what He’s teaching them and how He’s moving—is a wonderful way to deepen our understanding of who He is and His love for us. We seek to foster this connection through our studies, and our blog and occasional events. While we encourage you to find community within your local church, we recognize that it’s not always readily available. Regardless, you are invited to join our community!            </p></p>
            <h3>New Life: (The Gospel of Christ)            </h3>
            <p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the good news of God's offer of salvation and eternal life through Jesus Christ. This is the essential first step in the journey of all Christ-followers and disciples. 
            </p>
            <p>The Gospel is centered on:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>God's Love:</strong> God loves all people and desires a relationship with them. Despite human sin and separation from God, His love remains constant.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Jesus' Life and Sacrifice:</strong> Jesus Christ, God the Son, came to earth, lived a perfect life, and willingly sacrificed Himself on the cross to pay the penalty for humanity's sins. His death and resurrection provide the means for reconciliation with God.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Forgiveness and Redemption:</strong> Through Jesus' sacrifice, anyone who believes in Him can receive forgiveness of sins and brought into a right relationship with God. This is a gift of grace, not something earned by human effort.
                </li>
                <li><strong>New Life:</strong> Belief in Jesus leads to the assurance of eternal life in Heaven and the direction and empowerment of the Holy Spirit to guide believers to live according to God's will.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Invitation:</strong> The Gospel invites everyone to respond by faith—trusting in Jesus for salvation and committing to follow Him. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you have never decided to put your faith in Jesus’ death and resurrection as the sacrificial atonement for your sin, you can do that right now through prayer. Talk to God and tell Him your decision to trust Jesus, then ask Him to lead and guide you throughout your life until you see Him face-to-face one day! 
            </p>
            <p>THEN…Email us at <a href="mailto:info@jamiehulker.com" class="no-style-link"><strong>info@jamiehulker.com</strong></a> and let us know about your new life in Christ! We’d love to pray for you as you begin this journey and give you some resources and direction for your next steps!
