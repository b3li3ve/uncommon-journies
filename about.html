Whether you’re a new believer or have walked with God for years, our goal is to offer resources that engage both your heart and mind—for God’s glory!</p>                </p>

                    <p><strong><em>Jamie Hulker: Here for You</em></strong> is a ministry that has been stirring in my heart for years. I am constantly amazed by how God has pursued me and graciously included me in His work—sometimes in spite of myself! This shaping and seasoning in my life has been an unexpected blessing, one I didn’t even know to ask for, but I am deeply grateful.
                    </p>
                    <p>While the Bible and the Holy Spirit have been the primary influences in my journey, a crucial part of my growth came through the investment of my long-time mentor and friend, Jerry, who is now face-to-face with Jesus. His life was a beautiful example of investing in others—equipping and encouraging them to grow in Christ through studying God's Word and supporting them as they lived out their callings. My life and ministry are essentially the fruits of his investment. Jerry often referred to this as a "trunk ministry"—he saw himself as the tree trunk, serving God by providing what the branches needed to thrive as they served God and others.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to continuing that legacy at Jamie Hulker: Here for You. You may have already guessed that the word "You" in our name carries a double meaning, embodying this mission: to honor and serve God by honoring and serving others. However, please know that this is not a solo mission—it’s a community effort. My long-time friends, trusted ministry partners, and family are all part of this journey, each contributing to this ministry from their own unique giftings and callings. I am blessed to have a front-row seat to all of this and excited to watch how the Lord will use this community to impact all of us!</p>
                    <p>As we move forward, I’m also blessed and grateful to be on this journey with you, trusting that God’s leadership will continue to guide us all for His glory.</p>

                <h3 id="jamie">Jamie's Story</h3>
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Hi! I’m Jamie, and I’d love to share a bit about my journey. I grew up in the rural South, where my family’s faithful church attendance instilled in me two foundational Biblical truths: Jesus died for my sins, and He will one day return. I embraced these truths early on and am deeply grateful for the eternal impact that church had on my life (if this idea is new to you, you can learn more about it <a href="blog.html#new">here</a>). However, these truths didn’t automatically shield me from the trials of being an adventurous, independent, and somewhat rebellious teenager and young adult. Thankfully, God didn’t leave me wandering in that space for long.</p>
    
                    <p>In college, the influence of Christian friends, a vibrant college ministry, a mentor, and a Bible-teaching church revealed to me the vital role of God’s Word, prayer, and Christian community in a disciple’s life. I realized that these four essentials were exactly what I had been missing.</p>
    
                    <p>Since then, my adult life has been dedicated to pursuing these essentials. I’ve had the blessing of serving in full-time ministry, working on church staff, and volunteering as a lay leader. My journey has taken me to over 30 countries across six continents, where I’ve shared the Good News about Jesus and taught others about walking as His disciples. I've also written and taught Bible studies, organized conferences, and led events, focusing on these vital Christian disciplines.</p>
    
                    <p>I’m also a research nerd who recently channeled that passion into earning an MA in Ministry from Moody Theological Seminary. This academic journey deepened my love for studying the Scriptures through the historical-grammatical method, which informs everything I write and teach. Coupled with my life experiences, this approach enables me to translate biblical truth into everyday language, helping others grasp its depth for themselves.</p>
    
                    <p>Additionally, I deeply value unity in the Church. Some of Jesus' last words are found in a prayer for Christian unity (John 17:20-21), and last words are never wasted on unimportant matters. While I stand unapologetically on biblical truth, I will never seek to divide or push an agenda that is not essential to the Christian faith. It is my prayer that this approach will honor God and help foster unity within His Church. </p>
    
                    <p>The ministry of <em><strong>Jamie Hulker: Here for You</strong></em> flows from this lifetime of learning and serving God. As a sister in Christ, author, Bible teacher, International Study Guide, and Mission Team Leader, my heart is to leverage my seasoned experience to provide well-researched resources, opportunities, and inspiration that authentically impact lives.</p>
    
                    <p>Beyond my ministry work, my personal life keeps me grounded and inspired! I live in Franklin, TN, with my husband, Bryan, and our two fun-loving dogs. I’m a proud parent of adult children and excited to be a new MiMi to our granddaughter. I enjoy being part of a diverse community, learning from others, and making meaningful connections.</p>
    
                    <p>I currently teach at my home church and local events, and I’m always up for a coffee chat about life’s adventures. In my spare time, you’ll find me traveling, hiking, reading or paddle boarding with my dogs.                     </p>
