                        <h4>Esteemed: God and His View of Women</h4>
                        <p>Imagine a Bible study that brings the stories of women in Scripture to life with the same depth and reverence often reserved for other biblical figures. Now, you don’t have to imagine—it’s here. Together, we’ll explore thirty-three accounts of women from the Old and New Testaments, along with three inspiring stories from history. These women, esteemed by God, played crucial roles in His divine plan, standing as heroes and role models for all of us. From national leaders and deliverers to prophetesses, disciples, church planters, missionaries, mothers, and more, their stories offer a biblically and historically grounded view of God’s heart for women.</p>
                        <p>But this study goes beyond simply recounting others’ stories—it invites you to step into your own God-given purpose. As you uncover fresh insights into how real women, facing real challenges, followed God and served others, you’ll be inspired to follow their example—for His glory and others’ good.                       </p>

                        <h4>The Bible</h4>
                        <p>There are a variety of good Bible translations available. Here are the distinctions and our recommendations for each:</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>A <strong>Literal Translation:</strong> Stays as close as possible to the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts, preserving the exact wording and structure (Recommended: New American Standard).</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Dynamic translation: </strong>Focuses on conveying the meaning of the original text in a way that's easier to read and understand, even if it moves away from the exact wording (Recommended: New Living Translation or New International Version).</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Paraphrase:</strong>  Rewords the original text to express ideas and concepts using modern language and ideas (Recommended: The Message).</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Amplified Version:</strong> Combines literal and dynamic approaches, offering expanded translations of keywords for a better understanding of the meaning (Highly recommended, especially if you can’t access other resources).</li>
